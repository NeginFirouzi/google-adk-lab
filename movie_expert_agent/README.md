#  ðŸŽ¬ movie expert agent

This is a simple movie agent I built for fun in my free time. It can:

- Recommend movies

- Compare movies

- Provide movie info

- Share fun trivia

I didnâ€™t spend much time gathering data. I used two datasetsâ€”movies_metadata.csv and credits.csvâ€”from [The Movies Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv), and created a simplified version: movies_simple.csv.

Itâ€™s a basic prototype for now and definitely needs improvementâ€”but it works!

Hereâ€™s how it looks in action:
